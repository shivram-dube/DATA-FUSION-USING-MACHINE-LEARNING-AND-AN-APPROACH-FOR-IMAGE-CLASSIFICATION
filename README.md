# DATA-FUSION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING-AND-AN-APPROACH-FOR-IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION

Aim and Objectives:-
Based on the problem statement mentioned, the aim of proposed work is identified and formulated as follows.


Aim:-
Main goal of this project is to create an innovative technique for classifying the fused image of CT and MRI of brain tumors in two classes whether brain tumor disease is there or not. Particularly, goal is to improve the accuracy and beneficial value of brain tumor imaging by utilizing modern methods of machine learning, such as linear regression and fusion algorithms, to combine the complementing data from both modalities. By doing this study, the sole aim is to transform the area of brain tumor imaging and enhance patient care and medical outcomes by giving doctors a potent tool for precise tumor characterization, treatment planning, and monitoring. Objectives associated with the aim are summarized and described as follows.


Objectives:-
•	To develop a simple data fusion mechanism by using Discrete Wavelet Transforms (DWT).
•	To evaluate the DWT-based developed mechanism by using performance identified evaluation parameters.
•	To develop a data fusion mechanism using machine learning by exploring linear regression.
•	To evaluate the linear regression based developed model by using performance identified evaluation parameters.
•	To develop fused image dataset by utilizing existing CT and MRI images of normal brain and brain tumor.
•	To develop classification model for brain tumor presence using fused image dataset and deep learning.
•	To evaluate the deep learning based developed classification model by using identified performance evaluation parameters.
